### Install Python in Ubuntu

Ubuntu 20.04 and other Debian Linux distributions are shipped with the Python 3 installed by default. You can confirm if python is available by using the below command.

`python3 -V`

You’ll see the python version installed as below.

`Python 3.8.2`

If it’s not installed, you can install Python3 on Ubuntu by using the following command.

`sudo apt install python3.9`

If you want to install a different version of Python, you can update the version number by changing the version at the install script.



### How to run the application in Ubuntu

You can pass the arguments to python from the Linux command line by specifying the argument’s value next to the commands. If you have two or more commands, you can separate them with the space.

Use the below command to pass var1, var2 to the python script file IntegerToRomanConverter.py.

`python3 IntegerToRomanConverter.py var1 var2`

Now, your program will accept this command-line argument and process it as defined in the script.
